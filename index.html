        <h4>Rules For New Developers</h4>
        <li>
            <a href="#" class="accordion">1. Never stop learning.</a>
            <p class="accordion_detail">Technology advances by leaps and strides ever 3 years. If you stay stuck on only what you know, you will be left behind and your skills and knowledge will become irrelevant. Keep up with current trends in the tech world, but do not try to just onto every single one at the same time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#" class="accordion">2. Know more than one language</a>
            <p class="accordion_detail">A true developer or engineer can pick up just about any language and within a few minutes start writing code. Even if its the first time they have seen that language. Knowing only one language and only being able to program in that language means you are just a programmer or code monkey as they are commonly called.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#" class="accordion">3. Everyone wants something for free</a>
            <p class="accordion_detail">our friends, your family, random strangers from the internet, it doesnâ€™t matter. As a developer, you will be constantly hounded by family, friends, and strangers alike, because EVERYONE has the next million/billion dollar idea, they just need you to build it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#" class="accordion">4. Always have side projects</a>
            <p class="accordion_detail">Every developer should have a side project. That the whole reason you became a developer in the first place right? To make the awesome and amazing things in your mind a reality!</p>
